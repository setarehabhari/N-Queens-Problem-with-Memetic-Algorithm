# N-Queens-Problem-with-Memetic-Algorithm
Designing a memetic algorithm to solve the N queens problem
N Queens puzzle is the problem of placing n chess queens on an n Ã— n hessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

For solving this problem we will use a type of genetic algorithms named Mememtic ALgorithms which uses a local search technique to reduce the likelihood of the premature convergence. Most of this algorithm is similar to our last homework so i won't get into their details
